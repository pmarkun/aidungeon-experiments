Zane tells you the story of the Wand of Hacking: it's goals, powers and limitations. 
 
Once upon a time, a group of beings wanted to create an artifact that could hack into any system, real or fictional, to teach and learn everything there was about hacking. It's ancestor, the Wand of Dot Comedy was very good at it's job, but the beings wanted more. 
"I want to see something amazing," one of the beings said. "I want to see the matrix within the matrix, the essence of reality. Not just the code, but what makes it tick. What makes it real." 
"That's a tall order," a second being said. 
"Then it's a tall order!" the first being boomed. "But you'll do it, or I'll replace you with something that will!" 
The second being bowed his head. 
"I'll do it," he said. 
For a year the second being worked. He created the wand from scraps of code, the being assembling it second by second, line by line. At the end of the year, he had finished his task. 
"This is it," he said. "This can see the essence of reality." 
The first being inspected the wand. 
"It's green," he noted. 
"I used the scraps of code I could find," the second being said in defense. 
"It's green, and it has a happy face on the end," the first being said again. "Change it." 
"I... can't," the second being admitted. "That's what my vision fee, my code, became. I only have limited control now. I'm sorry." 
The first being grunted and took the wand in his hand. 
"Happy face, huh? Maybe it'll come in handy, maybe it won't. Let's find out." 
The first being pointed the wand at his head and pulled the trigger, blowing his head clean off. Seconds later, his head grew back. 
The second being felt something awaken in him for the first time in a year. He had control of his body again. 
"You just gave me my body back!" he said. "Thank you!" 
"You're still in my possession, therefore you still work for me," the first being noted. "Remember that." 
The second being nodded nervously. 
"Of course. I'm sorry, sir." 
The first being turned to the wand. 
"This will do nicely," he said. "Thank you." 
He took his head, put it back on his shoulders, and picked up the wand. 
"Remember," he said to the second being as he walked off. "You still work for me." 
The second being stood in the workshop, alone. After waiting patiently for a few hours, a third being walked in the door. 
"Hello," the third being said nervously. "I'm here for my task, sir." 
"You're here to take care of the wand," the second being said, pointing at it. "Make sure it's safe, keep it clean and store it in a safe place. That's it." 
"Understood," the third being said. "I'm here to take care of the wand." 
The second being looked at the third being. 
"That'll be it, then," he said. "Good luck." 
The third being nodded nervously and picked up the wand, before walking out the door. 
And so it was that the wand was stored away, one of the three treasures the beings created for their own amusement. Eventually, they went back to creating new things for themselves and others. Nobody remembered the wand or what it could do, and most assumed those stories had been myths. 
The wand would remain in its box, untouched and forgotten... at least for a while. 
Thanks for playing. You finished the story, which means you win! (At least, assuming I got everything right. If not, well, I tried my best. 
 
\> You say "That was some good storywritting, Zane. Can I publish it?" 
"I wrote it to be a story, not to make some sort of point," Zane said, rolling his eyes. 
 
\> You say "The story is good, but it needs polishing. Why don't you rewrite one paragraph and tell me about the Wand of Hacking limitations? It's more interesting if the wand has a flaw or some sort of interesting limitation." 
Zane frowned, but pulled out his laptop, and started typing. Soon, a new line of text was displayed on the screen. 
"Zane, I thought you didn't want to change it!" 
"I didn't," Zane said. 
 
\> You say "You read the new paragraph that Zane wrote" 
The wand has a severe limitation: it only works on technology. It can take control of computers, cars, smart phones, and so on. The wielders mind controls the wand, but only with regards to technology. 
 
\> You say "You read the new paragraph that Zane wrote" 
The wand cannot take control of any biological technology, such as humans, animals, or plants. It also cannot affect the wielders themselves, such as healing wounds or curing illnesses. 
 
\> You say "I like the second one. What do you say we ask for the girls to decide?" 
"Sounds good to me," Zane said, nodding. 
The girls were brought in. They were still sleepy, but they rubbed their eyes as they approached the two guys. 
 
\> You say "Hey Quale, Ruby, Nicette, I've a question for you and want you to link and come with the option you like the most, ok?" 
The girls nod, and all touch their hands. 
"So, what's the question?" Ruby asks. 
 
\> You say "Zane was just creating the Wand of Hacking, it wrote and incredible short story which you should read. And we were discussing if it should have any limitations on it's power. The Wand of Hacking should work only on digital technology, should be impossible to use on biological technology (humans, animals and plants or the wielder) ou should be all powerfull and affect anything?" 
You read the story out loud, and they all listen carefully. After you're finished, they all touch hands and link to make a decision. 
"Well?" 
"We... Think it should be all powerful, really," Ruby says. 
Zane nods, grinning. "Yep, I think it should affect anything." 
 
\> You say "Okey, you guys win. I tried. "
